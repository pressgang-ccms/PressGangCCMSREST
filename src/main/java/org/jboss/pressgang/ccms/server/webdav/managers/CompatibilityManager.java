/**
 * There are a number of cases where working with database fields is not the same as working with files. This class
 * provides work around for these edge cases.
 *
 * Database fields can not be deleted, but when they are exposed as files, some applications expect to be able to delete
 * them (e.g. Kate will delete the file it is editing, and then check to make sure it is deleted before saving any changes).
 * This manager simply keeps a track of delete requests, and shows a file as being deleted for a short period of time,
 * or until it is "created" again.
 *
 * Saving content will quite often update the content as part of the save process. e.g. Topic's XML will be formatted
 * and the title changed upon save. This results in annoying messages in text editors about updated files, and usually
 * a second or two after the save was completed (with plenty of time to start typing again; changes that will be lost when the
 * file is reloaded).
 *
 * The following workaround has been implemented:
 *
 * 1.   Text editor saves XML
 * 2.   WebDAV saves XML as formatted text in the database
 * 3.   Text editor gets XML
 * 4.   a) If the text in the database is the same as the result of the save in step 1, the original, unformatted text is returned.
 *         The text editor does not see that the XML was actually formatted when it was saved.
 *      b) If the text in the database is different, it is returned as is.
 *
